Welcome to my new new blog and website! This is a pilot post for my
new blogging website, build with Hugo and Netlify. My posts will 
primarily revolve around technology, science, society, and the connections
between them.

<br>

At any rate, I hope you enjoy my posts. Feel free to check out the "About", 
and "Skills" pages for more information about me. Thank you again for visiting 
my blog, and feel free to contact via the email link below, if you care to.



Sincerely,

Dana
